# Ghost-Bot
A simple line following robot that can be hacked together easily and raced for the ultimate nerd (that's a term of endearment around here) street cred.

## Motivation
I like building things and I like hanging out with the Ghost Bat crew. Adam has done an excellent job of organising DCS Friday's (regardless of my lack of attendance) and has inspired me to try and do a similar thing with some hands on robotics/electronics/software workshops.

## Requirements
* Beginner friendly
    * Arduino based
    * Through hole components
    * No specialized equipment
* Low cost
    * "The best part is no part"
    * Build it, break it, repair it, build another one
* Able to be completed in a weekend
    * No Gantt chart required
    * Easier to herd the cats 

## Assembly
* Don't touch the hot end of the soldering iron

## We need you!
We need volunteers to perform V&V and see if we:
* Built the thing right
* Built the right thing

## How to order parts on Element 14
TODO add an instruction on how to use the BOM upload tool

## Credit
This robot is ~~shamelessly plagarised~~ inspired by a line following robot I built during my first year at uni. If Dr. Robert Ross ever sees this (anything can happen on the internet), thanks! I somehow misplaced the original, so any mistakes are mine and mine alone.
