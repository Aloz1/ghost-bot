# Ghost-Bot
A simple line following robot that can be hacked together easily and raced for the ultimate nerd (that's a term of endearment around here) street cred. 

## Motivation
I like building things and I like hanging out with the Ghost Bat crew. Adam has done an excellent job of organising DCS Friday's (regardless of my lack of attendance) and has inspired me to try and do a similar thing with some hands on robotics/electronics/software workshops.

## Requirements
* Beginner friendly
    * Arduino based
    * Through hole components
    * No specialized equipment
* Low cost
    * "The best part is no part"
    * Build it, break it, repair it, build another one
* Able to be completed in a weekend
    * No Gantt chart required
    * Easier to herd the cats 

## Assembly
* Don't touch the hot end of the soldering iron

## We need you!
We need volunteers to perform V&V and see if we:
* Built the thing right
* Built the right thing

## How to order parts on Element 14
TODO add an instruction on how to use the BOM upload tool

## TODO
* Ordered M2.5 hex spacers (2884589) and screws (1420388, box of 100), need to add to BOM. It would be nice to add them as mechanical parts to the schematic, just need to think about what the best way to do this is.
* Setup a Github Action to generate all the fabrication outputs
    * Gerber files
    * NC drill
    * Bill of materials
    * Drawings
